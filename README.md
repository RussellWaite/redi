# redi README

A simple redis UI

## Features

very basic right now, i.e. only 5% of features implented

Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[tree-view\]\(media/0.0.3.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

security concerns for storing of creds
no edit ability
poor value view ability
it's not exactly rapid
